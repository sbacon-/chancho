        This project was a game I made to teach programming to my little bro.<br>
        It is the greatest work I've ever not completed... <br>
        Were I a composer, this game would be my magnum opus.<br>
        <br>
        Here is what critics have said about Alfonso's Ice Cream Shop:<br>
            <q>They already have that</q><br>
            <q>This game trash</q><br>
            <q>I thought I told you don't come back here</q><br>
        <br>
        Truly a masterpiece. I love this project and hope to maybe add some <br>
        coherent game structure... maybe <br>
