        This project was a game I made to teach programming to my little bro.<br
        />
        It is the greatest work I've ever not completed... <br />
        Were I a composer, this game would be my magnum opus.<br />
        <br />
        Here is what critics have said about Alfonso's Ice Cream Shop:<br />
        <q>They already have that</q><br />
        <q>This game trash</q><br />
        <q>I thought I told you don't come back here</q><br />
        <br />
        Truly a masterpiece. I love this project and hope to maybe add some
        <br />
        coherent game structure... maybe <br />
