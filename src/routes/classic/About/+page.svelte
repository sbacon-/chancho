        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Tom. I make games, automation utilities, and
          websites.<br /><br />
          <img

            alt="Handsome man in glasses shaped like hearts"
          /><br />
          I taught myself to write Java programs 10+ years ago, and have loved it
          ever since.<br />
          I recently picked up C++; I'm very excited to start making games/applications
          with such a flexible and functional language.<br /><br />
          A few years ago, after some guidance from the Ludum Dare community, I decided
          to learn C# and the Unity Engine. I've participated in every compo since
          45, and the results seem to improve with every entry. I am familiar with
          a few other languages (Python, Kotlin, Python, JS, HTML/CSS, XML,and Visual
          Basic), but these I don't use so often.<br /><br />
          I am available for freelance programming if you have something you would
          like built: websites, games, apps etc. Check out the footer for contact
          info, and check out the my Github page for tools/inspiration in automating
          your own projects.
